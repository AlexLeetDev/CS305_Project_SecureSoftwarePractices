## 📖 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **CS 305 Secure Software Development** course at Southern New Hampshire University. The goal was to implement secure communication mechanisms for a fictional financial services company, **Artemis Financial**. The project demonstrates the implementation of secure coding practices, including **SSL/TLS encryption** and **SHA-256 checksum verification**.

> **Note**: This project is for academic purposes, and Artemis Financial is a fictional company used for this scenario.

## ⚙️  Key Features

- 🔒 **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Secures communication over HTTPS using a self-signed SSL certificate.
- 🛡️ **SHA-256 Checksum Verification**: Verifies the integrity of transmitted data.
- 📊 **Vulnerability Analysis**: Static code analysis conducted using OWASP Dependency-Check.

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the key files and their functionality:

- **`ChecksumController.java`**: Implements SHA-256 checksum functionality.
- **`SslServerApplication.java`**: The main entry point for the Spring Boot application.
- **`application.properties`**: Configures HTTPS and SSL certificates.
- **`pom.xml`**: Maven build configuration and dependencies.
