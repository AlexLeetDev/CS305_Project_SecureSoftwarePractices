## üìñ Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **CS 305 Secure Software Development** course at Southern New Hampshire University. The goal was to implement secure communication mechanisms for a fictional financial services company, **Artemis Financial**. The project demonstrates the implementation of secure coding practices, including **SSL/TLS encryption** and **SHA-256 checksum verification**.

> **Note**: This project is for academic purposes, and Artemis Financial is a fictional company used for this scenario.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Key Features

- üîí **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Secures communication over HTTPS using a self-signed SSL certificate.
- üõ°Ô∏è **SHA-256 Checksum Verification**: Verifies the integrity of transmitted data.
- üìä **Vulnerability Analysis**: Static code analysis conducted using OWASP Dependency-Check.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the key files and their functionality:

- **`ChecksumController.java`**: Implements SHA-256 checksum functionality.
- **`SslServerApplication.java`**: The main entry point for the Spring Boot application.
- **`application.properties`**: Configures HTTPS and SSL certificates.
- **`pom.xml`**: Maven build configuration and dependencies.

## üì∏ Screenshots

### üîê Checksum Verification

This screenshot demonstrates the **SHA-256 checksum verification** feature.

![Checksum Verification](assets/images/checksum_verification_5.png)

- **Data**: "Hello, this is Alex Leet!" is used as sample data for verification.
- **Checksum**: The generated SHA-256 checksum ensures the integrity of the transmitted data.
- **Generated On**: Timestamp showing when the checksum was created.
- **Valid Until**: Expiration timestamp, ensuring the validity of the checksum over time.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Application Output in Spring Boot Console

The console output shows the **Spring Boot** application starting and securing communication over HTTPS.

## üîç Vulnerability Assessment

As part of the project, a static analysis was performed using **OWASP Dependency-Check** to identify potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. The following table summarizes the critical and high-severity vulnerabilities found and their resolutions:

| Dependency                | Severity  | CVE ID          | Status               |
|---------------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `hibernate-validator-6.0.18` | Medium    | CVE-2020-10693  | Patched in updated version |
| `jackson-databind-2.10.2`   | High      | CVE-2020-36518  | Suppressed (false positive) |
| `spring-core-5.2.3.RELEASE` | Critical  | Multiple CVEs   | Patched               |

The complete Dependency-Check report is available [here](assets/reports/Dependency-Check-Report.pdf).

## üìù Reflection and Insights

1. **Summary of Client Needs**:
   Artemis Financial required secure communication to protect sensitive financial data during transmission. The goal was to implement encryption and data integrity checks to ensure the security of transmitted information.

2. **What I Did Well**:
   I successfully implemented **SHA-256 checksum verification** and **SSL/TLS encryption**, ensuring that data transferred between the client and the server was both secure and tamper-proof. These security measures are essential for protecting sensitive data and maintaining the trust of users.

3. **Challenges and Learnings**:

   - **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Configuring SSL/TLS encryption and certificates for secure communication was challenging, but it improved my understanding of encryption protocols and certificate management.

   - **Dependency Management**: Handling version conflicts in **Maven** dependencies required careful attention to ensure all libraries worked together without introducing vulnerabilities.

   - **Vulnerability Assessment**: Using **OWASP Dependency-Check**, I had to identify relevant vulnerabilities and filter out false positives, particularly for unused features, enhancing my ability to prioritize real security risks.

4. **Tools and Practices Used**:  
   - **Java Keytool**: For generating and configuring SSL certificates.
   - **OWASP Dependency-Check**: For static analysis of project dependencies to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Maven**: For project management and handling dependencies efficiently.

5. **What to Showcase to Future Employers**:
   This project highlights my ability to implement secure communication protocols like SSL/TLS, verify data integrity with SHA-256 checksum, and conduct vulnerability assessments using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check. These are important skills in secure software development.
